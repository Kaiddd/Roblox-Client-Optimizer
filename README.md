# Roblox Client Optimizer

RCO™ tweaks FFlags to optimize your Roblox client.

As seen in Sharkblox and Rubie's YouTube videos!

## Installation
You can use our installer and uninstaller files to install and uninstall the flags, but keep in mind this will not autoupdate, so keep an eye on our Discord server for update announcements so you know when to run the installer again.

Download them [here](https://github.com/L8X/Roblox-Client-Optimizer/releases/tag/Release) by clicking on RCO-Installer.cmd or RCO-Uninstaller.cmd.

See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aY7US2Zl47M) for information on how to install the flags manually.

Do you want to use the old autoupdating system? Check out the RCO™ 2 section below.

## RCO™ Supersonic
RCO™ Supersonic is our FPS and latency focused configuration file, you can get it [here](https://roblox-client-optimizer.simulhost.com/supersonic/ClientAppSettings.json).

## RCO™ 2
RCO™ 2 was our old flagship software which allowed you to automatically receive flag updates.

We do not officially maintain RCO™ 2 anymore, however you can find verified, safe, and vetted forks below:

Use this with care, as it is only intended for use by advanced users who maintain high levels of competency in programming, due to the lack of completion.
