# Archived Project

The maintainer has decided their time working on this project has come to an end.

## A short comment from the maintainer:

"Thank you for everyone who has supported RCO, it's been an amazing time, with ups and downs, but I cannot continue to maintain the project.

I hope RCO's legacy will inspire others to learn more about the inner workings of the Roblox client, just as I once did.

Fly high, people!"

# Roblox Client Optimizer

RCO tweaks FFlags to optimize your Roblox client.

As seen in Sharkblox and Rubie's YouTube videos!

The flags we edit are contained in our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/L8X/Roblox-Client-Optimizer/blob/main/ClientAppSettings.json).

## About RCO
Some things RCO does:
- Unlocks FPS
- Optimizes Caching
- Optimizes Graphics
- Optimizes Textures
- Increases user privacy
- Disables Crashpad / Backtrace crash metrics
- Disables a large portion of client telemetry
- Disables AbuseReportScreenshot
- Enables font and texture item preloading
- Enables FULL graphics quality options (21 instead of 10!)
- Enables QuickGameLaunch (RCOâ„¢ 2 only)
- Enables BatchAssetApi

## Installation
You can use our installer and uninstaller files to install and uninstall the flags, but keep in mind this will not autoupdate, so keep an eye on our Discord server for update announcements so you know when to run the installer again.

Download them [here](https://github.com/L8X/Roblox-Client-Optimizer/releases/tag/Release) by clicking on RCO-Installer.cmd or RCO-Uninstaller.cmd.

See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aY7US2Zl47M) for information on how to install the flags manually.
