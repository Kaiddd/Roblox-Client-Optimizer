# Roblox Client Optimizer

RCO™ tweaks FFlags to optimize your Roblox client.

As seen in Sharkblox and Rubie's YouTube videos!

The flags we edit are contained in our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/L8X/Roblox-Client-Optimizer/blob/main/ClientAppSettings.json).

## About RCO™
Some things RCO™ currently does:
- Unlocks FPS
- Optimizes Caching
- Optimizes Graphics
- Optimizes Textures
- Increases user privacy
- Disables Crashpad / Backtrace crash metrics
- Disables a large portion of client telemetry
- Disables AbuseReportScreenshot
- Enables font and texture item preloading
- Enables FULL graphics quality options (21 instead of 10!)
- Enables QuickGameLaunch (RCO™ 2 only)
- Enables BatchAssetApi

## Installation
You can use our installer and uninstaller files to install and uninstall the flags, but keep in mind this will not autoupdate, so keep an eye on our Discord server for update announcements so you know when to run the installer again.

Download them [here](https://github.com/L8X/Roblox-Client-Optimizer/releases/tag/Release) by clicking on RCO-Installer.cmd or RCO-Uninstaller.cmd.

See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aY7US2Zl47M) for information on how to install the flags manually.
