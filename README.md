# Roblox-Client-Optimizer

RCO automatically tweaks FFlags to optimize your Roblox client.

The flags we edit are contained in our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/L8X/Roblox-Client-Optimizer/blob/main/ClientAppSettings.json).

Why don't you give it a try?



See https://youtu.be/jc_mReB_SMc how to install the flags file.
